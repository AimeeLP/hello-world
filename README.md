# hello-world

A Panda walks into a bar and asks for a bowl of peanuts. Once he's finished the bowl he picks up his shotgun and takes aim at the ceiling and shoots before heading towards the door.

This rather shocks the barman, who screams "What the hell'd you do that for?!"

To which the Panda simply replies "I'm a Panda, look me up in the dictionary"

When the barman gets home that evening he pulls out the Dictionary, and there it is, "Panda: Eats, shoots and leaves"
