# hello-world

A Panda walks into a bar and asks for a bowl of peanuts
After he's finished the bowl he picks up his shotgun and takes a shot at the ceiling
Then heads out the door.

The barman screams "What'd you do that for?!"

The Panda turns around and answers "Look me up in the dictionary"

Dictionary
Panda: Eats, shoots and leaves
